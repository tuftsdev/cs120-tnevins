                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>notuber is a web service that allows people to look for a ride and for drivers to find passengers. <br/>
                    I was hired to do a security audit on their app to check for any vulnerabilities.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="row">
                <h3>Methodology</h3>
                <p>For this assignment I approached it primarily as a code review. I also did some black box testing once I had a list of the api urls where I then tested each api end point starting with cross site scripting to some simple sql injection. <br/>   
                    I examined the code line by line following the flow of events that occur at each api end. <br/>
                    To confirm findings then do some testing with a locally running version of the service where I would test one api endpoint at a time using a tool called thunder client, which is a visual studio code extension that is good for quick api tests. <br/>
            </section>
            <section class="row">
                <h3>Abstract of findings</h3>
                <p>
                    In my examination I found corss site scripting and multiple vectors for sql injection attacks, which are critical vulnerabilities. <br/>
                    My findings can be neatly summarized as poor sanitization and valdiation of user provided data. <br/>
                    I also found a few bad practices at play such as, using var keyword in global scope and not defining a non root database user. <br/>
                    The aforementioned critical vulnerabilities are fairly straight forward to mitigate.<br/> 
                    First sanitization of any user provided input is a must and will ensure your app gets what it needs to run. The second, and this applies only to the sql injection vectors, is to use prepared queries that except parameters using a client library.

                        var in the global scope is dangerous and a bad practice. It can create scoping, readability and other problems in your code base. 
                        This is especially critcal when used on imports or using the require() because the variables can be overwritten and will not be cuaght by compilers or IDE's. 
                        </p>
                      <h6 class="card-subtitle my-2">resolution</h6>
                      <p>Use the const keyword instead for setting require() and imports. <br/>
                        Then in local scope such as in functions use the keyword let for vaules that are mutable. <br/>
                        The const keyword will ensure that all compilers catch any unintentional varible value changes. <br/>
                        Using these keywords will also make your code easier to read and more in line with modern Javascript standards.</p>
